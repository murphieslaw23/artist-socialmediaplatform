    <h2>2. Content Guidelines</h2>
    Our platform is a community of artists, and we want to maintain a friendly and supportive environment. We do not tolerate hate speech, bullying, or discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or any other personal characteristic. Users must respect each other's creations and not criticize or demean another artist's work based on their personal beliefs or characteristics. We do not allow political discussions on our platform.

    We do allow explicit and gore content to be uploaded to our platform, but artists must mark their content as such, and users can choose to filter out such content if they do not wish to see it. However, we do not allow any pornographic content involving minors.

    <h2>3. Account Security</h2>
    To ensure the security of our users' accounts, we use a passphrase for account recovery. This passphrase is stored in the profile security settings. In the event that a user forgets their passphrase, they can reach out to us via our Twitter or Instagram accounts. We will ask some verification questions before the user can recover their account. To recover their account, the user must provide their username, email address, and the passphrase.
